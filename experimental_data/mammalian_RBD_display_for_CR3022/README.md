# Antibody binding to mammalian display RBD variants
For antibodies that are not neutralizing, such as CR3022, we can't validate mutants using neutralization assays.
Therefore, antibody binding to mammalian-displayed RBD provides a mechanism for validation.

The Python Jupyter notebook [analyze_display.ipynb](analyze_display.ipynb) fits curves to the data.
