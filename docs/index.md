# Complete mapping of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain that escape antibody recognition

Below are links to interactive visualizations of the effects of single mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain on recognition by ten monoclonal antibodies. These visualizations are built using [dms-view](https://dms-view.github.io/docs/). These data are posted in [this pre-print - broken link](link).
